# Bincom Python Basic Developer Test

This repository contains the solutions for the Bincom Python Basic Developer Test. The project involves web scraping, data analysis, and basic algorithmic problem-solving.

## 🚀 Overview
The primary task was to analyze dress color data scraped from a provided web page to solve nine specific statistical and mathematical questions.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main entry point that runs the full suite of solutions.
- `scraper.py`: Contains the logic for fetching and parsing the dress color data from the website.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone github.com
   cd bincom-python-test


📝 Solved Tasks
Mean Color: Calculated the average color of the dresses for the week.
Median Color: Identified the middle color in the frequency distribution.
Mode Color: Found the color worn most frequently.
Variance: Computed the statistical variance of the color frequencies.
Probability: Calculated the probability of a randomly picked dress being a specific color (e.g., Red).
Recursive Search: Implemented a recursive algorithm for a specified number search.
Random Number Generator: Generated a 4-digit number and converted it from binary to base 10.
Fibonacci Sequence: Summed the first 50 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Database Integration: Scripts to save to a database.
