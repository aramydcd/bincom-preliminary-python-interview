# Bincom Python Basic Developer Test

This repository contains the solutions for the Bincom Python Basic Developer Test.

# Technical Assessment Suite 🐍

A Python-based computational tool designed to extract, clean, and analyze categorical color data from unstructured web content.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Regex Extraction:** Automated parsing of HTML text patterns.
- **Data Normalization:** Built-in logic to handle and correct common data entry typos.
- **Statistical Suite:** Custom implementation for Mean, Median, Mode, and Variance.
- **Algorithm Implementations:** Features Recursive Search and Fibonacci summation logic.
- **Database Persistence:** Automated SQLite table creation and data insertion.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Standard Libraries:** `re`, `sqlite3`, `statistics`, `collections`, `random`

## 📁 Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main entry point that runs the full suite of solutions.
- `scraper.py`: Contains the logic for fetching and parsing the dress color data from the website.

## 📊 Logic Highlight: Median Color
The system calculates the median not just by sorting, but by performing a **cumulative frequency summation** to identify the exact middle-positioned color in the garment set.
